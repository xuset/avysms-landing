          Email your Colorado region to <strong>forecast&#64;avysms.com</strong> to receive the avalanche forecast from your InReach device
        </p>
        <p>
          Sending a text message to AVYSMS will work from your InReach but email has
          been more reliable in the past and is the recomended way for receiving
          avalance forecasts on your InReach device.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, <strong>emailing AVYSMS only works for InReach devices</strong>. Any email sent to this address that is not from an InReach device will not receive a reply. All other devices should use the phone number to text AVYSMS.
